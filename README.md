LevenshteinDistance and Search
* * *

[Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) is a string metric for measuring the distance between two strings. In this demo project, Levenshtein distance is used to sort search results in a UIViewController with UITableViewDataSource context. The goal is to have the most relevant/closest match results shown at the top.

The LevenshteinDistance class is an Objective-C/C implementation of the code found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5859561/getting-the-closest-string-match).

This project contains some example code using the LevenshteinDistance class in a UIViewController with a UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource, and UISearchDisplayController.  

Run the project in Xcode 4 using the iOS Simulator to see how it works.
